# OnTask v2.5

## Running the application

### For development

1. Perform the configuration steps outlined [here](#general-configuration)
2. Install [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose)
3. From your terminal, run `docker-compose build` followed by `docker-compose up` in the root OnTask directory
4. If this is the first time running, the following must be performed:
   - Attach to the backend container by running `docker-compose exec backend sh`
   - Initialise the database by running `python3 manage.py makemigrations accounts`, `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and lastly `python3 manage.py migrate`
   - Load data into user groups by running `python3 manage.py loaddata user_groups`
   - Create the first admin user by running `python manage.py createsuperuser`
   - Create a `term` Table in the ontask Database (you can use a Database client like [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)) and import `Term Codes.csv` (or create your own Terms). This is to ensure that you have Terms to search and create containers via the UI.
   `term` table should have fields: code (number), name (string), start (date), end (date)
5. In order to work with LTI via localhost, the application runs in SSL mode with self-signed certs
   - This will require adding an exception in your browser for both https://localhost:3000 and https://localhost:8000

### For production

1. Complete steps 1-4 from above, however, instead run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up` (in step 3)
2. Compile the frontend by running `npm run build` in the frontend directory
3. Serve the files in the `frontend/build/` directory as a static website (e.g. through S3 behind a CloudFront distribution)
4. Add a proxy pass in your webserver configuration from your backend domain (e.g. api.ontask.org) to http://localhost:8000 (not https)

## Configuration

### General configuration

1. Create an environment file `env.py` in the `backend/ontask/` directory
2. Run `pip install cryptography`
3. From a Python shell, run the following command:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
# The following generated secret key will be used for encrypting sensitive data
# Loss or change of the secret key will result in the loss of all datasource passwords
# This is a breaking issue for dynamic data sources, as update attempts will fail
Fernet.generate_key().decode("utf-8")
```

4. Configure the environment file as follows:

```python
SECRET_KEY = "<SECRET_KEY_GENERATED_ABOVE>"

 # List of admins that will recieve user signup notifications via email
ADMINS = ["<ADMIN_EMAIL_1>"]

FRONTEND_DOMAIN = "https://<YOUR_FRONTEND_DOMAIN>"
BACKEND_DOMAIN = "https://<YOUR_BACKEND_DOMAIN>"
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["<YOUR_FRONTEND_DOMAIN>"] # Without the protocol specified

# If uncommented, use the given named profile from your AWS credentials
# file (usually ~/.aws/credentials). Otherwise, boto3 will assume the AWS role
# of the server itself
# AWS_PROFILE = "<YOUR_AWS_NAMED_PROFILE>"
AWS_REGION = "<YOUR_AWS_REGION>"
ENABLE_CLOUDWATCH_LOGGING  = False
DEMO_BUCKET = "<YOUR_S3_BUCKET>"

# SMTP credentials to enable email sending from OnTask
EMAIL_HOST = "<YOUR_SMTP_HOST>"
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_NAME = "OnTask" # Default name to appear in emails sent
EMAIL_ALIAS = "<YOUR_EMAIL_ALIAS>" # Default alias email to use in emails sent
EMAIL_HOST_USER = "<YOUR_SMTP_USER>" # SMTP login user
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = "<YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD>" # SMTP login password
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_BATCH_SIZE = 50  # Maximum number of emails to send at a time (i.e. a batch)
EMAIL_BATCH_PAUSE = 300  # Minutes to wait between batches of emails

# Configuration for AAF Rapid Connect
AAF_CONFIG = {
    "secret_key": "<YOUR_AAF_SECRET>",
    "aaf.edu.au": {
        "iss": "https://rapid.aaf.edu.au", # https://rapid.test.aaf.edu.au for dev
        "aud": "https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>", # https://localhost:8000 for dev
        "idp": "<YOUR_AAF_IDP>",
    }
}

LTI_CONFIG = {
    "staff_role": "Instructor", # Role that will be added to the instructor group when coming from LTI
    "consumers": {
        "ontask": { # App name registered in LTI
            "secret": "<YOUR_LTI_SECRET>"
        }
    },
    "url": "<YOUR_LTI_URL>",
    "username_field": "<YOUR_LTI_USERNAME_FIELD>", # Specify which field in the LTI payload maps to your institution's user ID
    "auto_create_share_containers": True # Allows for the auto creation and sharing of containers in lti context.
}
```

5. Create environment files `.env.development` (for development) and/or `.env.production` (for production) in the `frontend/` directory
6. Configure the environment file(s) created above:

```javascript
REACT_APP_API_DOMAIN = "https://<YOUR_BACKEND_DOMAIN>";
REACT_APP_AWS_ID = "YOUR_AWS_ID";
REACT_APP_AAF_URL = "<YOUR_AAF_IDP>";
// If uncommented, show the Register Account interface
// REACT_APP_DEMO = True
```
